# idris2-dsa-gen
Idris2 code based on Dependent State Automata diagrams.

# What?
If you have followed the Type Driven Development with Idris book, you may have
spotted some patterns in chapter 14 in terms of modelling dependent state
automata in Idris. This project attempts to auto-generate the Idris2 source-code
for these based on a DOT (`.gv`) file.
